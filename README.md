# computercraft

This repository contains code that I use in [computercraft](https://www.computercraft.info/), a mod that adds computers to Minecraft.  The programming language these computers use is Lua.

## door

 * simple_door.lua - password protects a door
 * admin_door.lua - password protects a door, also disabling `Ctrl-T` so no one can kill the program without the admin password

## networking

Work in progress, with the hopes of creating a distributed system for collecting and relaying information to a central computer.

## commands

Some commands that can be used in command blocks/computers.  Based on help from [digminecraft.com](https://www.digminecraft.com/generators/summon_mob_1_12.php).

## other
 * buttons.lua - first attempt at making touch screen buttons
 * fillChest.lua - used to fill a chest with items when it becomes empty

## TODO:

add screenshots of how these computers are set up
